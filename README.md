## Features
For the assignment, I decided on the problem statement to promote about the **variety of academic and career options available for fresh graduates** to choose from. 

For the **Academic** aspect, the website will showcase the **admission criteria for each autonomous local university** and highlight the **top 6 international universities**. 

For the **Career** aspect, the website will include **flipcards to promote the jobs available in the different industries** and a **fun mini quiz that tells graduates which industry is more relevant to them based on their interests**.

## Setup

1. Download the zipped files and open them in `Visual Studio Code`.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a new tab and **right click to open in browser**.

3. The rest of the URLs can be assessed by interacting with the navigation bar at the top of the webpage.
